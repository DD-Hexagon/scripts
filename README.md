# Clipper Migration Scripts

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to facilitate the migration of data from the Clipper system to new platforms. Each script processes specific data formats and generates output files essential for successful data migration and integration. These scripts ensure a smooth transition of application, user, group, and authorization server data into a new environment.

## Purpose
Migrating data from legacy systems like Clipper can be complex due to varying data structures and requirements for new platforms. These scripts standardize and process raw data into formats that align with modern data handling practices, preparing comprehensive CSV reports suitable for direct import or further processing.

## Scripts and Their Functions

### 1. **Application Data Processing (`application_data_processing.py`)**
- **Purpose**: Processes JSON data related to applications, including authentication flows, admin roles, tenants, and organization names.
- **Input**:
  - `applications.json`: Contains detailed application data.
  - `authorizationservers.json`: Maps application IDs to organization names.
- **Output**: `applications.csv` file with structured application information and consolidated tenant data.

### 2. **User Data Processing (`user_data_processing.py`)**
- **Purpose**: Extracts and processes user data, matching it with relevant organization names.
- **Input**:
  - `users.json`: Includes user details such as roles, email, and organization IDs.
  - `authorizationservers.json`: Used to map organization IDs to their respective names.
- **Output**: `users.csv` file containing user details, admin roles, and organization names.

### 3. **Group Data Processing (`group_data_processing.py`)**
- **Purpose**: Processes group data and organizes it for use in the new environment.
- **Input**:
  - `groups.json`: Contains data on user groups, including membership and associated details.
- **Output**: `groups.csv` file with structured group data ready for migration.

### 4. **Authorization Server Data Processing (`auth_server_processing.py`)**
- **Purpose**: Extracts information related to authorization servers, including policies, applications, and scopes.
- **Input**:
  - `authorizationservers.json`: Comprehensive data on authorization servers and their configurations.
- **Output**: `auth_servers.csv` file containing processed data on authorization servers and their relationships with applications.

### 5. **Tenant Data Integration (`tenant_data_processing.py`)**
- **Purpose**: Matches tenant IDs with their names and integrates this information into application data.
- **Input**:
  - `tenants.json`: Contains tenant details such as names and IDs.
  - `applications.json` and other related files to link tenant data with applications.
- **Output**: CSV files that consolidate application data with relevant tenant names.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Handling**: The scripts cover applications, users, groups, and authorization servers, ensuring that no data type is left behind in the migration.
- **Customizable Outputs**: Each script is flexible, allowing modifications to meet specific requirements, such as adding or removing columns, changing default values, or adjusting mappings.
- **Error Handling**: The scripts include checks for data inconsistencies, such as `None` values or unexpected types, to prevent errors during processing.
- **Concatenated Data**: For applications and tenants, the scripts can concatenate multiple values into a single column, simplifying data review.

## How to Use the Scripts
1. **Ensure Python is installed** on your system.
2. **Place the necessary input JSON files** in the same directory as the script you wish to run.
3. **Run the script** using:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
