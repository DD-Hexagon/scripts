Clipper Migration Scripts
Overview
This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to facilitate the migration of data from the Clipper system to new platforms. Each script processes specific data formats and generates output files that are essential for successful data migration and integration. These scripts ensure the smooth transition of application, user, group, and authorization server data into a new environment.

Purpose
Migrating data from legacy systems like Clipper can be complex due to varying data structures and requirements for new platforms. These scripts standardize and process raw data into a format that aligns with modern data handling practices. They prepare comprehensive CSV reports, making the data suitable for direct import or further processing.

Scripts and Their Functions
1. Application Data Processing (application_data_processing.py)
Purpose: Processes JSON data related to applications, including authentication flows, admin roles, tenants, and organization names.
Input:
applications.json: Contains detailed application data.
authorizationservers.json: Maps application IDs to organization names.
Output: applications.csv file with structured application information and consolidated tenant data.
2. User Data Processing (user_data_processing.py)
Purpose: Extracts and processes user data, matching it with relevant organization names.
Input:
users.json: Includes user details such as roles, email, and organization IDs.
authorizationservers.json: Used to map organization IDs to their respective names.
Output: users.csv file containing user details, admin roles, and organization names.
3. Group Data Processing (group_data_processing.py)
Purpose: Processes group data and organizes it for use in the new environment.
Input:
groups.json: Contains data on user groups, including membership and associated details.
Output: groups.csv file with structured group data ready for migration.
4. Authorization Server Data Processing (auth_server_processing.py)
Purpose: Extracts information related to authorization servers and their policies, applications, and scopes.
Input:
authorizationservers.json: Comprehensive data on authorization servers and their configurations.
Output: auth_servers.csv file containing processed data on authorization servers and their relationships with applications.
5. Tenant Data Integration (tenant_data_processing.py)
Purpose: Matches tenant IDs with their names and integrates this information into application data.
Input:
tenants.json: Contains tenant details such as names and IDs.
Other data files like applications.json to link tenant data with applications.
Output: CSV files that consolidate application data with relevant tenant names.
Key Features
Comprehensive Data Handling: The scripts cover applications, users, groups, and authorization servers, ensuring that no data type is left behind in the migration.
Customizable Outputs: Each script is flexible, allowing modifications to meet specific requirements, such as adding or removing columns, changing default values, or adjusting mappings.
Error Handling: The scripts include checks for data inconsistencies, such as None values or unexpected types, to prevent errors during processing.
Concatenated Data: For applications and tenants, the scripts can concatenate multiple values into a single column, simplifying data review.
How to Use the Scripts
Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Place the necessary input JSON files in the same directory as the script you wish to run.
Run the script using:
bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the name of the script you wish to execute.
Check the output CSV file, which will be generated in the same directory as the script.
Data Migration Workflow
Run application_data_processing.py to prepare application data with tenants and organization mappings.
Run user_data_processing.py to generate user data reports with linked organizations.
Run group_data_processing.py for organized group data.
Run auth_server_processing.py for detailed reports on authorization servers and their policies.
Integrate tenant information using tenant_data_processing.py as needed.
Customization and Extensions
Modify Mappings: Update dictionaries for application types, admin roles, and other mappings to align with your specific data needs.
Add New Scripts: Extend the repository with additional scripts if more data types need to be migrated or processed.
Adapt Columns: Customize the column names and data selection to match the format required by your target system.
